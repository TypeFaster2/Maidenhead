 This sketch is used to get location from GPS then display
 the MaidenHead location

*************************************************************/

This code is run on Arduino to provide Maidenhead location, also known
as Grid Squares. These are used in Amateur Radio to enable quick location identification.
Mostly used in VHF and UHF comms.

Most of the features of the GPS have been brought out to the Serial port, and a fair
amount have been brought out to the LCD.

There is a blog about the project at : http://typefaster.tumblr.com/

The related Eagle file was built think I'd make my own PCB. It was intended to be
a single sided board, using an Arduino chip. I never followed through with it. So 
probably a bit dodgy.
