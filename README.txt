*************************************************************/

This code is run on Arduino to provide Maidenhead location, also known
as Grid Squares. These are used in Amature Radio to ebale quick location identification.
Mostly used in VHF and UHF comms.

Most of the features of the GPS have been brought out to the Serial port, and a fair
amount have been brought out to the LCD.

There is a blog about the project at : http://typefaster.tumblr.com/
